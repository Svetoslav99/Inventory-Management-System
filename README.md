# Inventory Management System
 Course project regarding building an example application that is working with the database and has user interface.
 
 - The CSS architecture is ITCSS and it was used the BEM methodology for naming the classes.
 - The backend was written on nodejs with express for the API and for DB it was used MySQL

NOTE: I did not use any framework such as React/Angular/Vue on purpose for this current course project.
